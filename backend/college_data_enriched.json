Charantimath Chairman, B. V. V. Sangha, Bagalkote\nBasaveshwar Engineering College (BEC) is a premier Technical Institute recognised at National level catering to the needs of rural masses in Northern part of Karnataka. Ever since its inception in 1963 with only three\ndisciplines, now in 2021 BEC has 9 UG & 8 PG programmes and is recognised at National level by securing NIRF ranking persistently for the past 3 years. I have been very closely associated with BEC from the day I took\ncharge as the Chairman of B. V. V.
